# open-core
Welcome to the Core. Take the red pill, and venture forth.

This is a web application that can be used to interact with the [Core](http://github.com/buhrmi/core). It can also serve as a frontend for the [Stellar Galaxy Network](http://www.stellar.org/galaxy).

# See it running
http://open-core.meteor.com (temporary URL, server donation accepted :P)

# Run it locally

## Prerequisits

* Install [Meteor](http://meteor.com/install)
* Access to a Core Postgres database. You can set one up yourself. See [here](https://github.com/buhrmi/core/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.
* It also helps to be familiar with [Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/galaxy/)
